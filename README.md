# StudySpace Finder System

Universities rely on scheduling systems to manage shared spaces. In this project, you will build StudySpace Finder, a system that assigns students to the nearest available study room that meets requested constraints.
Functional Requirements
Room Management
•	Add rooms (ID, capacity, features)
•	Search rooms
•	Remove rooms
Reservation Scheduling
•	Make reservation
•	Cancel reservation
•	Prevent conflicts
Nearest Room Routing
•	Given student location + requirements
•	Find nearest valid room
•	Display route
Required Data Structures & Algorithms
Your implementation must include the following:

Requirement	Data Structure / Algorithm
Room records	Hash Map (roomID → Room)
Building lookup	Hash Map (buildingID → Building)
Reservation storage per room	Balanced BST / TreeMap or sorted list by time
Conflict detection	Interval overlap check (on sorted reservations)
“Next available room” selection	Priority Queue / Heap (earliest available start time)
Campus/building map	Weighted Graph (adjacency list)
Routing	Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
